# Fraud-Detection-System

**Overview**
An established food retailer has introduced a self-scanning system that allows customers to
scan their items using a handheld mobile scanner while shopping. This type of payment
leaves retailers with the risk that a certain number of customers will take advantage of this
freedom to commit fraud by not scanning all the items in their cart. Empirical research
conducted by suppliers has shown that discrepancies are found in approximately 5% of all
self-scan transactions. The research does not differentiate between the actual fraudulent
intent of the customer, inadvertent errors, or technical problems with scanners.

**Objective**
To minimize losses, the food retailer hopes to identify fraud cases using targeted follow-up
checks. The challenge here is to keep the number of checks as low as possible to avoid
unnecessary added expense as well as to avoid putting off innocent customers due to false
accusations. At the same time, however, the goal is to identify as many false scans as
possible.
Create a predictive model to classify the scans as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The
classification does not consider whether the fraud was committed intentionally or
inadvertently.
